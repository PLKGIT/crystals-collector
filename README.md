## Playing the Game
* A random number between 19-120 is generated at the start of each game
* Click on any of the four (4) crystals on the left to add points to your score
  * Each of the crystals will have a random value between 1-12 
* You will not know the value of any crystal until after you click it and the value of each crystal will change at the start of each new game
* Win the game by clicking the right combination of crystals whose values, when summed, equal the random number
* You'll lose the game whenever your score exceeds the random number.
